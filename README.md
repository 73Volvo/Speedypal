# Speedypal
A digital dashboard for Speeduino
<br>
This project started off with some code I found in Miata-Ardugauge https://github.com/iltHeo84/miata-ardugauge, which was based on Ardugauge. https://github.com/MielArrojado/speeduino-ardugauge <br>
<br>
Demonstration: <br>

<br>
I tested it with a Seeed Xiao ESP32S3 CPU <br>
An SD card is required for proper functioning <br>
<br>
It can work with two buttons <br>
It can work with or without a DS3231 RTC for clock input <br>
It can work with or without an .96" or 2.42" OLED screen <br>
It can work with one or two OLED screens <br>
<br>
Connections <br>
Left Button = D1 <br>
Right Button = D2 <br>
SD Card Chip Select = D3 for Seeed ESP32S3, 21 for Seeed Sense with built-in SD <br>
TX = D6 <br>
RX = D7 <br>
<br>
Features: <br>
See all the stats from the Speeduino <br>
Log stats from Speeduino in ASCII or binary<br>
Display stats in a line graph<br>
Display stats in a bar graph<br>
Calculate stats like MPG, HP, Torque, 0-30 times, 0-60 times<br>
<br>
This is a draft, I'll post more when I get the chance! <br>

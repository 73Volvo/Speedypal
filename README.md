# Speedypal
A digital dashboard for Speeduino
<br>
This project started off with some code I found in Miata-Ardugauge https://github.com/iltHeo84/miata-ardugauge, which was based on Ardugauge. https://github.com/MielArrojado/speeduino-ardugauge
<br>
I tested it with a Seeed Xiao ESP32S <br>
An SD card is required for proper functioning <br>
<br>
It can work with or without an RTC for clock input <br>
It can work with or without an .96" or 2.42" OLED screen <br>
It can work with one or two OLED screens <br>
<br>
Features: <br>
See all the stats from the Speeduino <br>
Log stats from Speeduino in ASCII or binary<br>
Display stats in a line graph<br>
Display stats in a bar graph<br>
Calculate stats like MPG, HP, Torque, 0-30 times, 0-60 times<br>
<br>
This is a draft, I'll post more when I get the chance! <br>
